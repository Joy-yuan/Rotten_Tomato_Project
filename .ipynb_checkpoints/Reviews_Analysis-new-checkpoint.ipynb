       "   ' Calling it a sum of its parts can be a backhanded compliment, but it feels like especially worthy praise for Boyhood, considering how much went into making it feel whole. ',\n",
       "   ' We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.',\n",
       "   ' While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.',\n",
       "   \" It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.\",\n",
       "   \" A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching.\",\n",
       "   \" Linklater's casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce.\",\n",
       "   ' Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.',\n",
       "   ' An exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story.',\n",
       "   ' The closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.',\n",

       "   ' Is it dumb to say, \"Wow?\" I don\\'t care. Wow.',\n",

       "   \" Richard Linklater's latest feels more like living a life than watching a movie. It's a one-of-a-kind experience.\",\n",
       "   ' Any film that takes twelve years to shoot should be commended for its stamina alone; yet no sense of grind, still less of fatigue, attends this Richard Linklater project.',\n",

       "   \" One of the most remarkable moviegoing experiences I've ever had.\",\n",
       "   ' Linklater and his team have done something incredibly difficult and made it look effortless. The result is easily one of the best films of the year.',\n",
       "   ' I have long maintained that Richard Linklater is the most gifted and audacious director of his generation. His new movie, Boyhood, which runs 2 hours and 44 minutes, is a stunning reconfirmation.',\n",
       "   ' The film gives every appearance of happening exactly the way life does, And exactly the way life does, it makes you care.',\n",

       "   ' The film ends and the credits come up and you ask the same question that you ask at the end of an evening spent with old, dear friends: where did the time go?',\n",

       "   ' There isn\\'t anything else quite like \"Boyhood\" in the history of cinema, although that wouldn\\'t matter one-fifth as much if it weren\\'t a moving and memorable viewing experience in the end.',\n",
       "   ' An extraordinarily intimate portrait of a life unfolding and an exceptional, unconventional film in which not much else occurs. Never has so little meant more.',\n",

       "   ' The film is lengthy -- almost three hours -- and without much plot, but I sat rapt for every minute.',\n",
       "   ' \"Boyhood\" is a transporting experience about the simplest of subjects. The movie telescopes artfully - but never pretentiously - the experience of growing up.',\n",
       "   ' Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie.',\n",

       "   \" I can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power, and the melancholy, of film's intimate enmeshment with time in the way Richard Linklater's Boyhood does.\",\n",
       "   ' A heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the United States over the past 12 years - and one that makes you care such much about the struggles and foibles of its imperfect characters.',\n",
       "   \" Richard Linklater's coming-of-age tale is the best movie of the year, a four-star game-changer that earns its place in the cultural time capsule. \",\n",
       "   ' A quiet stunner of a movie that yields to time rather than try to bend it to its will.',\n",
       "   ' As he has throughout his career, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters.',\n",
       "   ' If there was ever project that demanded to be informed by the history of its making, \"Boyhood\" is it. Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater\\'s incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling',\n",
       "   \" Boyhood fills you with openhearted happiness and awe at its scope and daring. It's a low-key masterpiece, a wistful comedy that never forgets to keep genuine emotions foremost.\",\n",
       "   \" Linklater's third masterpiece in the past decade should only affect anyone who's ever been someone else's sibling, child, parent, lover or friend.\",\n",
       "   ' Perhaps never has the long arc of the journey from childhood to college been portrayed as cohesively and convincingly as Richard Linklater has done in a film that can be plain on a moment-to-moment basis but is something quite special in its entirety.',\n",
       "   ' There\\'s a rough-edged, organic quality to \"Boyhood\" that recalls the work of those European helmers Linklater so admires: Fassbinder, Bergman, Bresson.',\n",
       "   \" The film has that deadpan Linklater tone of slacker haphazardness, but you could also say that it's almost Joycean in its appreciation of the scruffy magic of everyday life.\",\n",
       "   ' Boyhood is a narrative drama, but it unfolds like documentary truth.',\n",

       "   ' This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.',\n",
       "   ' It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.',\n",
       "   ' At its heart, \"The Babadook\" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.',\n",
       "   ' In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.',\n",

       "   ' Credit writer-director Jennifer Kent for lending her Australian indie a healthy dose of brains and subtlety, giving it a distinct advantage over most modern horror films.',\n",
       "   ' \"The Babadook\" is urgent, uncanny and entirely disturbing, a dream within a dream within a nightmare. It is the best English language supernatural film of this new century.',\n",

       "   ' The finest and most genuinely provocative horror movie to emerge in this still very-new century.',\n",
       "   ' The Babadook makes everyday domestic life seem like the most natural possible place to encounter monsters of every description, including the monsters that we ourselves have the capacity to become.',\n",

       "   \" Although the supernatural seems the likeliest answer, it's not the only one, and audiences can read the film either way.\",\n",
       "   ' A small film that packs a horribly big punch.',\n",

       "   \" Knightley... not only brings to life a woman discovering new desires and needs and finding the strength to act on them, but conveys the inner toil of the writer's creative process.\",\n",
       "   ' \"Colette\" is smart, conscientious and absorbing, and gradually, in its diligent way, achieves a certain fascination.',\n",
       "   ' As a tale about a woman whose life was defined by fire, \"Colette\" lacks much of a spark.',\n",
       "   \" The premise is simple and based on a true story, but the movie gives the audience a plot with more layers than meets the eye. It's probably a slow burn for some, but the story is gripping with eye-catching visuals.\",\n",
       "   ' Colette is a character-driven movie, but also one that is sending a message about social mores and their malleability.',\n",

       "   \" As a traditional period biopic, it checks all the boxes in fine fashion, but you'd never know it was inspired by a woman whose life was expansive and contradictory and unwieldy in the extreme.\",\n",
       "   ' A radiant, riveting Keira Knightley meets every challenge the title role of French novelist Colette throws at her and turns this tale of a pioneering feminist into an exhilarating kick.',\n",

       "   ' Takes a light, enjoyably fizzy approach to its subject.',\n",

       "  2018,\n",
       "  [' [Post] is anchored by a strong performance by Chloe Grace Moretz.',\n",
       "   \" A timid drama with a passive voice that doesn't align with the importance of its subject matter.\",\n",
       "   \" Told through the perspective of a hormonal girl in a community that disapproves of her desires, it's like explosives in the head and heart.\",\n",
       "   \" The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a modest-size film that performs a service opposite to that of Conversion therapy: It respects the vulnerability that accompanies the emergence of any young person's sexuality.\",\n",
       "   \" Akhavan keeps the camera locked on Moretz's face; every time you think she can't possibly go closer, she does. But it's the definition of a female gaze.\",\n",
       "   ' \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\" is a scrapbook made by the people who were there.',\n",
       "   \" It's loaded with terrific performances all around and, under the skilful stewardship of director Desiree Akhavan, it's a well-crafted story steeped in poignancy, melancholy and simple truths.\",\n",
       "   ' This is essentially a movie about teenagers stuck in an overly strict summer camp, and watching youths quietly whiling away the hours in a detention center is not exactly scintillating conflict.',\n",
       "   ' \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\" offers a powerful rejoinder to anyone who\\'d shame people into denying their authentic selves. In its own modest way, it\\'s one of the year\\'s bravest films.',\n",
       "   ' \"Miseducation\" more often opts for nuance than burlesque, and that is its strength.',\n",
       "   ' The director has enough faith in her audience to risk making all of the characters complicated, multifaceted and true-to-life.',\n",
       "   \" Moretz' wry smile and weary eyes convey volumes of emotional turmoil. She is the soulful, courageous heart of a film that exalts the strength of human dignity.\",\n",
       "   ' A handsomely retrofitted after-school movie.',\n",
       "   \" The Miseducation of Cameron Post may not hit as hard as it should. But it at least suggests that the only real losers in life are those who presume to read God's mind.\",\n",
       "   \" This is a film about Cameron's core personhood, and how it stands up to concentrated efforts to transform it, and it's told with quiet steeliness and grace.\",\n",
       "   \" A sweet indie film in the tradition of John Hughes. Calmly directed by Desiree Akhavan, the movie doesn't get tangled in the weeds of politics, but instead focuses intensely on its lovely characters.\",\n",
       "   \" It's hard to think of a more highly-charged topic than the brainwashing of vulnerable adolescents in the name of God, so it's certainly to Akhavan's credit that she uses such a determinedly understated style.\",\n",
       "   ' The Miseducation of Cameron Post is a sharply observed study - with a knife edge of satire, for sure - of the daily practice of soft tyranny by people not gifted with healthy self-doubt.',\n",
       "   ' Navigating troubled culture-war waters with grace, humor and compassion, \"The Miseducation of Cameron Post\" is a movie that deserves a wide and diverse audience.',\n",
       "   ' Chloë Grace Moretz plays Cameron with such tasteful reserve, all blank stares and slightly agape mouth in the face of the most ardent down-is-up doctrine.',\n",
       "   ' What a shame that this well-meaning and timely look at the absurdity of gay conversion camps - it won the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance this year - lacks the teeth to make its points stick. ',\n",
       "   ' The film takes a grown-up approach to its young-adult material; this is a somewhat somber YA adaptation, with teenage subjects who are fully formed and all too human.',\n",
       "   \" This movie may wander, but Akhavan's attention to perfect little moments is unwavering.\",\n",
       "   ' The action is schematic and the characters are thinly sketched.',\n",
       "   ' A thoughtful if somewhat shapeless drama about the struggle between human instinct and ideology, populated by finely-drawn characters...',\n",
       "   ' A clear-eyed examination of a self-assured female gay character from the past, both ahead of her teenage years and the era through which she lived them.',\n",
       "   ' The repressive setting would be, in a less nuanced film, a site of unadulterated horror. But Cameron, Jane, and Adam, like queer people through the ages, find ways to bond, joke, and help each other through the circumstances.',\n",
       "   \" Desiree Akhavan's Sundance-winning drama pulls back the curtain on gay-conversion camps, offering a valuable (albeit simplistic) alternative to self-questioning young viewers.\",\n",
       "   ' The people in this story are flesh-and-blood examples of a tragic emotional Stockholm Syndrome that should not be. I just wish the story did more with them.',\n",
