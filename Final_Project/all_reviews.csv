Boyhood,2014,"["" Like Michael Apted in his Seven Up! documentary series, Linklater makes you feel as if you're watching a photograph as it develops in the darkroom."", ' Calling it a sum of its parts can be a backhanded compliment, but it feels like especially worthy praise for Boyhood, considering how much went into making it feel whole. ', ' We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.', ' While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.', "" It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness."", "" A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching."", "" Linklater's casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce."", ' Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.', ' An exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story.', ' The closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.', ' Linklater has crafted what may be the most ingenious film of the century here and given it a tone like no other ...', ' Is it dumb to say, ""Wow?"" I don\'t care. Wow.', "" The year's most captivating narrative experiment, and possibly the most engrossing coming-of-age movie in the history of the genre."", ' Boyhood understands the tumult of childhood and adolescence as well as it does the hurdles and satisfaction of raising children.', "" Richard Linklater's latest feels more like living a life than watching a movie. It's a one-of-a-kind experience."", ' Any film that takes twelve years to shoot should be commended for its stamina alone; yet no sense of grind, still less of fatigue, attends this Richard Linklater project.', "" I can't help but think there may have been a better movie still lurking in his accumulated footage, one that with a mild shift in emphasis might have been titled, more ambitiously, Adulthood."", ' Few filmmakers ever make a great movie. Fewer still ever make a movie that expands what movies can express. Richard Linklater does both with Boyhood.', "" So, while it's tempting to say that nothing happens in Boyhood, that would be wrong. What happens is everything."", ' ""Boyhood"" is a stunt, an epic, a home video, and a benediction. It reminds us of what movies could be and - far more important - what life actually is.', "" To say Boyhood wouldn't be that special if it were shot in a conventional manner is kind of like saying that elephant in the zoo wouldn't be so big if it weren't so big."", "" Linklater's writing is typically warm and insightful, and the cast is uniformly excellent, including Ellar Coltrane as the quiet, down-to-earth hero."", ' ""Boyhood"" is not just a great movie, it\'s a landmark achievement in film.', ' As a film that dares to honor small moments and the life they add up to, ""Boyhood"" isn\'t just a masterpiece. It\'s a miracle.', ' ""Boyhood"" is a cinematic gift, a compassionate and sometimes amusing drama about growing up that extracts truths out of what appear to be life\'s most random moments.', ' To sit with this movie and witness the concentrated passage of time is to watch, in a true, moving way, your life unspool before your eyes, without fanfare or idealism or romance.', ' In completing this simple, beautiful project Linklater took his time. And he rewards ours.', ' Boyhood, at its best, boasts qualities that are usually under-valued in avant-garde work: tingling observations, unforced comedy and quirky, enduring charm.', "" One of the most remarkable moviegoing experiences I've ever had."", ' Linklater and his team have done something incredibly difficult and made it look effortless. The result is easily one of the best films of the year.', ' I have long maintained that Richard Linklater is the most gifted and audacious director of his generation. His new movie, Boyhood, which runs 2 hours and 44 minutes, is a stunning reconfirmation.', ' The film gives every appearance of happening exactly the way life does, And exactly the way life does, it makes you care.', "" This is more than a groundbreaker: It's a new American classic. "", ' The film ends and the credits come up and you ask the same question that you ask at the end of an evening spent with old, dear friends: where did the time go?', ' A marvelous, minimal epic of a movie ...', ' There isn\'t anything else quite like ""Boyhood"" in the history of cinema, although that wouldn\'t matter one-fifth as much if it weren\'t a moving and memorable viewing experience in the end.', ' An extraordinarily intimate portrait of a life unfolding and an exceptional, unconventional film in which not much else occurs. Never has so little meant more.', ' Boyhood is an epic masterpiece that seems wholly unconcerned with trying to be one.', ' These are people you know, maybe people like you.', ' On rare occasions a movie seems to channel the flow of real life. ""Boyhood"" is one of those occasions.', ' The film is lengthy -- almost three hours -- and without much plot, but I sat rapt for every minute.', ' ""Boyhood"" is a transporting experience about the simplest of subjects. The movie telescopes artfully - but never pretentiously - the experience of growing up.', ' Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie.', "" It's a collage of ordinary fragments that, in the end, add up to a greater whole."", "" There's never been a movie quite like Boyhood, and it may be years before anyone works up the gumption to match its achievement."", "" I can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power, and the melancholy, of film's intimate enmeshment with time in the way Richard Linklater's Boyhood does."", ' A heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the United States over the past 12 years - and one that makes you care such much about the struggles and foibles of its imperfect characters.', "" Richard Linklater's coming-of-age tale is the best movie of the year, a four-star game-changer that earns its place in the cultural time capsule. "", ' A quiet stunner of a movie that yields to time rather than try to bend it to its will.', ' As he has throughout his career, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters.', ' If there was ever project that demanded to be informed by the history of its making, ""Boyhood"" is it. Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater\'s incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling', "" Boyhood fills you with openhearted happiness and awe at its scope and daring. It's a low-key masterpiece, a wistful comedy that never forgets to keep genuine emotions foremost."", "" Linklater's third masterpiece in the past decade should only affect anyone who's ever been someone else's sibling, child, parent, lover or friend."", ' Perhaps never has the long arc of the journey from childhood to college been portrayed as cohesively and convincingly as Richard Linklater has done in a film that can be plain on a moment-to-moment basis but is something quite special in its entirety.', ' There\'s a rough-edged, organic quality to ""Boyhood"" that recalls the work of those European helmers Linklater so admires: Fassbinder, Bergman, Bresson.', "" The film has that deadpan Linklater tone of slacker haphazardness, but you could also say that it's almost Joycean in its appreciation of the scruffy magic of everyday life."", ' Boyhood is a narrative drama, but it unfolds like documentary truth.', ' Unshakable, witty and deeply felt, the film will be paying emotional dividends for a long, long time.']"
The Babadook,2014,"[' A deftly inventive and psychologically charged horror story that trades on the ways in which the prospect of maternal failure can be just as fearsome a boogeyman as any monster under the bed.', ' The film has a solid grasp on the mutable, but ever-present pain of loss. ', "" The line between terrifying reality and terrifying fantasy isn't so much blurred as altogether obliterated."", ' This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.', ' It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.', ' At its heart, ""The Babadook"" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.', ' In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.', "" As someone who has developed a pretty thick Critic's Shield from years of watching standard haunted house/possessed human/mythological-creature fare, I have to say I was genuinely freaked out by some of the passages in The Badabook."", ' The Babadook makes a convincing argument for classy, psychological horror cinema even as it fails to meet its own lofty standard. ', "" This is a dark and shivery story about motherhood, a common subject for horror movies, but one that's rarely treated with such intelligence or seriousness of intent."", ' Kent has taste, an eye and a knack for brisk, accelerated pacing. In the case of ""The Babadook,"" familiarity breeds an eerily gratifying contentment.', ' Writer-director Jennifer Kent lets the dread creep in slowly, and wisely goes easy on the effects; she knows that hand-drawn pop-ups can be more than enough to unsettle things', "" Jennifer Kent's startling debut is an artful horror-chiller that gets under your skin and into your psyche."", ' Credit writer-director Jennifer Kent for lending her Australian indie a healthy dose of brains and subtlety, giving it a distinct advantage over most modern horror films.', ' ""The Babadook"" is urgent, uncanny and entirely disturbing, a dream within a dream within a nightmare. It is the best English language supernatural film of this new century.', ' With its mixture of frights both literal and literary, ""The Babadook"" will, I suspect, satisfy horror\'s devotees as much as the genre\'s doubters.', ' This is a really scary movie.', "" Sometimes you go to a movie and know from the first image that whoever made it knows what she's doing. You don't need convincing. You're there with her. Jennifer Kent's The Babadook is like that."", "" Director Kent has made the kind of striking film that is going to have mainstream Hollywood haunting her like a Babadook in a bad mood. For the sake of her idiosyncratic vision, let's hope she doesn't frighten easily."", "" No matter how successful The Babadook turns out to be - and Jennifer Kent's horror story deserves all the success it gets - the prospects of a best-selling kid-lit tie-in don't look good."", ' A potent journey through the fears, anxieties, and repressed rages of motherhood.', ' Shot in chilly shades of blue, ""The Babadook"" will haunt anyone who\'s ever heard a cry in the night - or wondered what was under the bed, in the dark.', ' The finest and most genuinely provocative horror movie to emerge in this still very-new century.', ' The Babadook makes everyday domestic life seem like the most natural possible place to encounter monsters of every description, including the monsters that we ourselves have the capacity to become.', ' The Babadook makes the most of its special effects as needed, but this smart little frightener keeps its head close to the rising anxiety of a young widow whose husband died a violent death.', ' You will be scared. And also, perhaps even more scarily, moved.', "" Although the supernatural seems the likeliest answer, it's not the only one, and audiences can read the film either way."", ' A small film that packs a horribly big punch.', ' ""The Babadook"" is a smart, darkly drawn modern-day horror movie of monsters, memories and mothers.', "" In an age when horror movies have mostly become lazy and toothless, here's one with ambition and bite."", ' This psychological thriller from gifted first-time filmmaker Jennifer Kent will have you climbing the walls simply by plumbing the violence of the mind. Brace yourself. ', "" It's the most horror I've felt at a horror film since Neil Marshall's The Descent, one where the scares don't release the tension - they harrow."", ' ""An exceptionally rich psychological portrait of a woman, it\'s an enormously compassionate and sadly relevant film about misplaced blame and the often impossible demands of motherhood.""', "" I like to imagine watching this chilling Australian horror film with late, great authors Shel Silverstein, Roald Dahl and Edward Gorey - all of whom would have relished its twisted children's storybook at the center of things."", ' What really distinguishes The Babadook, however, is the metaphorical potency of its narrative.', ' One of the smartest and most effective horror films in years.', ' This is a different kind of nail-biter that has less to do with demonic possession than with the renegade power of an untamed imagination.', ' Let a law be passed, requiring all horror films to be made by female directors.', ' Manages to deliver real, seat-grabbing jolts while also touching on more serious themes of loss, grief and other demons that can not be so easily vanquished.', ' An impressively chilling exercise in old-school restraint.', ' Who thinks up a film like The Babadook? Actress-turned-debuting-feature-director Jennifer Kent has the narrative chutzpah to show her entire hand in the pop-up story and then make us squirm as foretold events come true.']"
The LEGO Movie,2014,"[' The movie is a wonderful surprise, cleverly written and executed brick by brick with a visual panache.', "" Lord and Miller's sensibilities are continually clever, and The Lego Movie works hard to gradually deliver surprising payoffs to what seem to be throwaway bits."", ' The Lego Movie has enough wit and wisdom to send a recession-age message to families on the importance of thinking through problems with creativity.', ' As a rule, movies about toys need to be approached with extreme caution; some of them have been bad enough to count as health hazards. This one is the exception.', ' This is truly a movie that children and their parents can both enjoy for different reasons.', ' The Lego Movie: Merely a great film, or the greatest film ever in the history of cinema?', "" The visuals are spectacular, the 3D technology is artfully used and the story is jam-packed with so many funny lines, it's hard to catch all the jokes that are delivered in rapid-fire succession -- constantly tweaking many popular culture icons."", ' The brightly-imagined Lego Movie is a wickedly smart and funny free-for-all, and sassy enough to shoot well-aimed darts at corporate branding.', ' A total gas--even if its message is that we should do as Lego says, not as Lego does. ', "" I stopped laughing because after 20 minutes, I'd had enough. The conceit gets stale fast."", ' A manic and surprising comedy inspired by toys that has more imagination and creativity than all the Transformers pictures combined.', "" It still might be a 100-minute commercial, but at least it's a highly entertaining and, most surprisingly, a thoughtful one with in-jokes that snap, crackle and zoom by at warp speed."", "" A movie that's fast-paced and silly with enough throwaway clever in-jokes for their accompanying adults to justify a second viewing."", ' What could easily have been test-marketed, corporate-processed crap ... instead becomes a surprisingly enjoyable and satisfyingly dense family entertainment that pays tribute to the spirit of free play and individuality.', ' A clever, vividly imagined, consistently funny, eye-poppingly pretty and oddly profound movie ... about Legos.', "" It's the smartest, funniest and most dazzlingly inventive children's movie to come along in years."", ' A spirited romp through a world that looks distinctively familiar, and yet freshly inventive.', "" For the most part, it's a hoot. There's more ingenuity packed into one minute of this film than there is in the entire running time of most animated amusements."", "" The Lego Movie maybe be one giant advertisement, but all the way to its plastic-mat foundation, it's an earnest piece of work - a cash grab with a heart. Made for, with and about Legos, the movie is also made for, with and about imagination ..."", ' The best part is what the movie has to say about conformity -- following the instructions on the box -- versus creativity, i.e. life as a jumble, an inspired improvisation, a joyous hodgepodge.', ' My fingers rebel, but type it I must: ""The LEGO Movie"" is the first great cinematic experience of 2014.', ' ""The Lego Movie"" is a marvelous piece of work.', ' I\'m probably overselling it, but at one point during The LEGO Movie, I found myself thinking, ""This is it. This is the one. This is the film that our entire shared experience of pop culture has been building towards.""', "" While clearly filled with affection for - and marketing tie-ins to - the titular product that's front and center, it's also something of a sharp plastic brick flung in the eye of its corporate sponsor."", ' Warning: Choking hazard - laughter.', "" Much of the time it makes other movies based on toys look like child's play."", ' ""The Lego Movie"" is a massive collision of subversive humor, hyper-kinetic energy, mind-jangling design, spinning colors and about 15 million Legos, no exaggeration.', ' Writer-directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who displayed a knack for slapstick with 21 Jump Street, fill the script with delightfully absurd one-liners and sharp pop culture references.', "" Lord and Miller don't sink into cynicism. Their computer animation embraces the retro look and feel of the toys to both ingenious and adorable effect."", ' Take the kids to The LEGO Movie - the funniest, cleverest, most exhaustingly exhilarating animated feature in ages - then leave them to play with their toys and see it again for your own wicked amusement.', ' Pop-culture jokes ricochet off the heads of younger viewers to tickle the world-weary adults in the audience, with just enough sentimental goo applied at the end to unite the generations. Parents will dab their eyes while the kids roll theirs.', ' Miller and Lord have gone far beyond the call of duty. Their Lego Movie is effervescent in style, conveying a substantive message without ever devolving into saccharine preachiness.', "" The filmmakers could have easily made one long, monotonous ad for the beloved brand that's been around for more than 55 years. Instead they've created a delightful tale championing self-reliance and distinctiveness."", ' Though it falls apart a bit near the end, ""The Lego Movie"" is easily the best movie ever made about plastic interlocking blocks, and good fun by any measure.', ' A goofy cartoon that will sell enough tickets and toys to keep the bosses happy while facing head-on the fact that these bricks are kinda, well, fascist.', ' As cute and energetic as it is, ""The Lego Movie"" is more exhausting than fun, too unsure of itself to stick with any story thread for too long.', ' The slightly glitchy movement of the characters is funny, the animation is awesome, the deconstruction of superheroes is brilliant and the jokes are knowing and slightly edgy.', "" It's fast and original, it's conceptually audacious, it's visually astonishing, and it's 10 times more clever and smart and funny than it needed to be. Here, at last, is an animated comedy that never stops surprising you."", "" Like the toy it's based on, it's goofy and colorful and something adults and children can enjoy together."", "" This isn't just the funniest PG-rated animation in too long; it's the funniest film, period, in months ..."", ' The script is witty, the satire surprisingly pointed, and the animation tactile and imaginative.', ' A full-throttle, giddily inventive, all-ages joyride that buoyantly boosts the bar for 3D computer-animated movies.', "" Bright, colorful, fast and noisy, The Lego Movie will doubtless tickle young fans of the toys. It's just too bad that a movie that encourages you to think for yourself doesn't follow its own advice."", ' Phil Lord and Christopher Miller irreverently deconstruct the state of the modern blockbuster and deliver a smarter, more satisfying experience in its place, emerging with a fresh franchise for others to build upon.']"
Nightcrawler,2014,"[' Like an alternate version of Network in which Faye Dunaway cannibalizes the conscientious William Holden character, Nightcrawler cleverly dispenses with any debate about the tyranny of ratings and the erosion of privacy.', ' A gritty urban comedy noir, a scathing, Network-worthy disembowelment of television newsgatherers that will leave you craving a shower.', "" It seems like a lot of satirical hue and cry about a social problem I'm not sure the nation is currently plagued by. Are local TV news stations really conducting daily bidding wars over the goriest footage random freelancers can bring them?"", ' Crashes and crime scenes are his bread and butter. He is driven. He is innovative. He is happy. He is also a monster - a fiend who preys on people at their weakest and worst moments. ', ' Now 33 years old, Gyllenhaal is the same age that De Niro was in Taxi Driver and, like him, he is learning to channel an eerie, inner charisma, offering it up in glimpses and glimmers rather than all at once.', ' For a first-time director, Gilroy demonstrates an uncommon assurance, not only in his audacious tonal shifts but in the stellar work he elicits from his cast and crew.', "" A mesmerizing cipher, Lou is a spiritual descendant of Robert De Niro's Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, and of the withholding protagonists in the existential French crime films of Robert Bresson and Jean-Pierre Melville"", "" After a few minutes you know everything about Louis you're going to know; the only surprise in Nightcrawler is the level of grotesqueness it achieves."", ' [Gilroy] wants Louis, who perpetrates some ghastly escapades, to epitomize the sick soul of media exploitation, but he also celebrates him as an entrepreneurial go-getter who is just giving us hypocrites what we secretly (or not-so-secretly) crave.', "" Howard's intrusive score enhances the sense that Nightcrawler is a movie and nothing more. Which is fine, of course. But the movie's movie-ness makes you aware that a statement is being made without articulating what it is."", ' It\'s hard not to be fascinated by the dark places Gyllenhaal goes here. But ""Nightcrawler"" falls short as social commentary or even psychological yarn. Like Louis, it talks a good game that crumbles as you ponder it.', "" It's a 21st-century takedown of the media's pandering ''if it bleeds, it leads'' ethos and the ghoulish nightcrawlers who live by it."", ' This is a classic film, not just because every scene and line is casually beautiful and devoid of extraneous touches, but because its tone is mercilessly exact.', ' A movie for the pleasure of movie audiences pretending to be shocked by a story of ghoulish media.', "" 'Nightcrawler' manages to be a scathing look at ambition and journalistic sensationalism while still delivering as a dark thriller."", "" Nightcrawler savages the news media's ratings-driven ethic (a most unethical ethic) with such force, it brings to mind Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet's Network."", ' ""Nightcrawler"" executes its ideas with tremendous craft and cool, and the courageous and counterintuitive pairing of its leads - Russo is 60, and Gyllenhaal 33 - produces two electrical, interlocking performances and undeniable erotic chemistry.', "" This isn't fun, escapist entertainment but, when it works, it's fascinating and compelling and makes us take a hard look at what TV news is selling and where it's getting the product."", ' A smart, engaged film powered by an altogether remarkable performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, it is melodrama grounded in a disturbing reality, an extreme scenario that is troubling because it cuts close to the bone.', "" It's a solid first time out in any event, entertainingly obvious at some points, obvious-obvious at others, and jazzed to have a rich subject and a star willing to run with it."", ' Nightcrawler serves as a phenomenal showcase for Gyllenhaal, who is never less than riveting . A full package of tics, tension and breathless patter, this self-taught entrepreneur stops at nothing, evoking a Taxi Driver for the TMZ age.', ' Writer-director Dan Gilroy wants it both ways - snarling comedy and gripping thriller - and for the most part he gets what he wants.', ' For his directing debut, Gilroy is out for the contact high of that Mean Streets vibe, and Gyllenhaal and Russo deliver it to him in spades.', ' Dan Gilroy\'s ""Nightcrawler"" is a dark dream of a thriller, full of evil that floats like a toxic cloud across an already tainted city.', "" True to its title, creeps under the viewer's skin much like the predatory title character, who restlessly cruises through this modern-day media allegory like Travis Bickle's long-lost, hyper-wired West Coast cousin."", "" One of the year's most satisfying and original thrillers."", ' No matter how extreme or unlikely the scenario, we want to know how Lou will handle it. Gyllenhaal makes this antihero funny, scary and fearlessly strange.', ' Nightcrawler curves and hisses its way into your head with demonic skill. This is a deliciously twisted piece of work. And Gyllenhaal, coiled and ready to spring, is scarily brilliant. ', ' There are moments that are too macabre and outlandish, but Gilroy steers the movie just this side of farce, just this side of Chayefsky, and keeps it all within a realistic framework.', ' ""Nightcrawler"" is the kind of movie that rarely hits multiplexes anymore, an edgy, pulpy thriller with a social conscience and a vicious satirical streak.', ' Gyllenhaal delivers his best performance to date.', ' ""Jon Stewart could learn a thing from Gilroy\'s rightly ruthless excoriation.""', ' A compelling and altogether impressive directorial debut for screenwriter Dan Gilroy', ' A modest and effectively executed urban thriller, suspenseful and entertaining in its clammy, overwrought way.', ' Gilroy ... is directing for the first time here, but he clearly has not only an understanding of actors, but an appreciation for image.', "" Despite the familiarity of its themes ... Gilroy's clever, skeezy little noir is worth a prowl."", "" Nightcrawler is well worth seeing just for Gyllenhaal's spectacularly creepy performance."", ' A thick film of sleaze coats every frame of ""Nightcrawler,"" a movie that takes a hard look at media culture and provides Jake Gyllenhaal a terrific opportunity to creep us all out.', "" Thirty pounds lighter, all cheekbones and bulging eyes, Gyllenhaal plays one of the year's most memorable characters in this dark, provocative drama."", "" The drama feels heightened and overwrought, and yet it works; you can see Nina's cold-eyed desperation, and Lou's creepy rapture as he realizes that he can get a shot that nobody else has."", ' It ultimately proves questionable and unconvincing, but in this case, failure to launch is noble. It keeps you creeped out and fascinated.', ' In real life, nobody could obstruct as much justice as Louis does and get away with it. Still, Nightcrawler is unnerving because we never know just how far Louis will go.', ' It scuttles ahead, wide-eyed, antennae waving, on a journey to the end of the night, and toward a future when nothing will not be shown.', "" The wildly evocative film proves there's a Lou Bloom lurking inside most of us. He's just the one willing to cross the yellow police tape. "", ' Gyllenhaal pushes himself even further as the unforgettable Lou Bloom, a sociopath with a pretty solid business plan who taps into a vein of darkness in Los Angeles that proves a profitable one. ', ' First and foremost, the film is a showcase for its wiry and wired star, and for the fascinatingly amoral anti-hero he brings to life.', "" Gyllenhaal, who summons career-best work, simply couldn't have played this character a few years ago."", "" Like his erratic protagonist, Gilroy doesn't always know when to settle down or call it quits, and the film's constant shifts of tone can grow tiring, even if the action as a whole never gets boring."", "" A feast of capital-A acting that's sometimes amusing to watch but not believable for so much as a second."", "" If Billy Wilder's 'Ace in the Hole' and 'Network' had a mutant baby, it would probably look like Dan Gilroy's 'Nightcrawler'"", ' A fantastic, sleek and fun satire.']"
Life Itself,2014,"["" With Ebert's blessing and encouragement, Life Itself is a warts-and-all look at how the son of an Illinois electrician and housewife became a prolific writer who spent 46 years as the film critic at the Chicago Sun Times."", "" What comes through most in Life Itself, a film named after Ebert's 2011 memoir, is his great, open-minded vigor."", "" If you aren't moved by Life Itself, you ought to have your heart examined."", "" The film's core is footage shot during the last four months of Ebert's life, when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak. It's hard to see him in this state, which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable."", "" No less than James's capital punishment documentary At the Death House Door, this asks us to think long and hard about what it means to die with dignity."", "" That [Siskel and Ebert] weren't very nice to each other might be the too-easy takeaway of outtakes of their on-set interactions.

He'd be proud to know that the movie of his life is sugar-free."", ' As this riveting documentary proves, two thumbs up made up only a small part of the total man. ', ' A tribute and historical perspective on the man behind a pop-cultural phenomenon.', ' This movie is never maudlin or sentimental. It shows us a man who, whatever his flaws, seemed to live his life in exactly the right way.', "" Life Itself reminds you how unpredictable Ebert's tastes: He loved Benji the Hunted and tore Scarface and Blue Velvet apart.

Mine sure are."", ' Ebert once described the cinema as ""a machine that generates empathy."" Watching James\'s lovely film, you know exactly what he means.', "" What makes Life Itself such a wonderful documentary is that it weds Ebert's passion for the good things in life to his quest to find great movies."", "" [Ebert's] clear, sensible prose will probably hold up better than some of the more frantic efforts of his contemporaries. His greatest legacy, however, as this film documents, was his courage in the endgame of his life."", ' Incisive, graceful and, yes, deeply empathetic.', ' I love this movie.', ' A portrait of Ebert that is funny, moving, sad, harrowing and ultimately uplifting.', "" How fitting that America's most important movie critic has become the subject of a fine movie himself."", ' A beautifully paced tribute to a life well-lived.', "" It's another mark of the director's skill that he took me deeper into aspects of that life that I thought I knew the most about."", ' A captivating portrait of a man who embraced life and art, whose spirit never flagged even when his body did.', ' Deep currents of love and sorrow flow under the succession of often funny recollections of a busy life.

It celebrates colorful characters, an indomitable spirit and a generous mind.', ' ""Life Itself,"" filmmaker Steve James\' moving tribute to America\'s most popular film critic, serves as a poignant reminder of what a distinguished journalist and courageous man he was.', "" Ebert's honesty, his industry and most of all his bottomless enthusiasm for his métier make for a lasting monument."", ' A paradoxical and vitally overflowing character emerges: a compassionate moralist with vast appetites, a raucous public performer whose confessional candor had a nearly religious purity.', "" Ebert was a sparrer, a happy combatant, and the movies were always a springboard to a conversation. His life's work is well-represented here ..."", ' The film is a little soft, and tactful to a fault.
