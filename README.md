## The Goal of the project

## What we have been implemented:

#### 1.Scrap data & Data cleaning


### 2. Basic Analysis & Visualization 

We analyzed the box office distribution, genre trend, rating distribution and director explorations.


### FUN TIME! Know more about your favorite director!

This part allows reader to input his/her favorite director, and a chart indicates the genre and box office preference of this director will be returned.

### 3 Text Mining

### FUN TIME! Get your favorite movie's reviews!¶

This part allows reader to input his/her favorite movie's name, and the summarization based on our text mining model will be returned.

### 4. Modeling & Prediction

We applied Word Embedding, Lasso, Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost for box office prediction. And finally we choosed XGBoost model for its best performance.

### Fun Time! Let's predict box offices!¶

This part allows reader to input the movie index in our test data set, the predicted box office and real box office will be returned. (The trained XGBoost model could also be used for future box office prediction! But due to the complexity of data preprocessing and Lasso, we decided to use test data to realize this function.)
