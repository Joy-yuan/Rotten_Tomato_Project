## The Goal of the project

## What we have been implemented:

#### 1.Scrap data & Data cleaning

We also scraped all top reviews from movie critics for each movie from 2014 to 2018 in the "top 100 movies" list from that year. 
### 2. Basic Analysis & Visualization 

We analyzed the box office distribution, genre trend, rating distribution and director explorations.


### FUN TIME! Know more about your favorite director!

This part allows reader to input his/her favorite director, and a chart indicates the genre and box office preference of this director will be returned.

### 3 Text Mining

For each of the 500 movies, we conducted text summarization on all reviews. The program generates a short paragraph of summary of reviews for each movie.

In the 'FUN TIME!' section, you will also be able to type in any movie name between 2014 to 2018, and receive the summary of how critics evaluate this movie, given that this movie is in our database.

### 4. Modeling & Prediction

We applied Word Embedding, Lasso, Linear Regression, Random Forest and XGBoost for box office prediction. And finally we choosed XGBoost model for its best performance.

### Fun Time! Let's predict box offices!Â¶

This part allows reader to input the movie index in our test data set, the predicted box office and real box office will be returned. (The trained XGBoost model could also be used for future box office prediction! But due to the complexity of data preprocessing and Lasso, we decided to use test data to realize this function.)
