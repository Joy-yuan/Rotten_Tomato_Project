       "   ' We can quibble with small stuff in Boyhood. Supporting performances are variable, the sister drops out as a dramatic character ... I could go on. But the cumulative power is tremendous.',\n",
       "   ' While everything about Boyhood is done with extraordinary care, the master stroke was clearly the casting, 13 years ago, of a little Texas boy named Ellar Coltrane.',\n",
       "   \" It's like a time-lapse photo of an expanding consciousness.\",\n",
       "   \" A word about the film's epic length. Boyhood is 166 minutes long. Yet it is so affecting, so much a thing of wonder, that it could run forever and I would still keep watching.\",\n",
       "   \" Linklater's casual hand at storytelling, dealing out reel after reel of naggingly forthright enlightenment, turns this simple tale of a mother trying to do her best into something worth every second of the time it took to produce.\",\n",
       "   ' Boyhood is proof that a strange magic can still bloom amidst the tragedy that buffets human life.',\n",
       "   ' An exceptionally well-crafted coming-of-age story.',\n",
       "   ' The closest thing to a lived life that fictional cinema has yet produced.',\n",

       "   ' The film is lengthy -- almost three hours -- and without much plot, but I sat rapt for every minute.',\n",
       "   ' \"Boyhood\" is a transporting experience about the simplest of subjects. The movie telescopes artfully - but never pretentiously - the experience of growing up.',\n",
       "   ' Boyhood shimmers with unforced reality. It shows how an ordinary life can be reflected in an extraordinary movie.',\n",

       "   \" There's never been a movie quite like Boyhood, and it may be years before anyone works up the gumption to match its achievement.\",\n",
       "   \" I can think of few feature films in the history of the medium that have explored the power, and the melancholy, of film's intimate enmeshment with time in the way Richard Linklater's Boyhood does.\",\n",
       "   ' A heady film experience packed with so many telling details about life in the United States over the past 12 years - and one that makes you care such much about the struggles and foibles of its imperfect characters.',\n",
       "   \" Richard Linklater's coming-of-age tale is the best movie of the year, a four-star game-changer that earns its place in the cultural time capsule. \",\n",
       "   ' A quiet stunner of a movie that yields to time rather than try to bend it to its will.',\n",
       "   ' As he has throughout his career, Linklater proves himself as a filmmaker unconcerned with flash and dazzle but thoroughly compassionate and empathetic to a wide range of characters.',\n",
       "   ' If there was ever project that demanded to be informed by the history of its making, \"Boyhood\" is it. Epic in scope yet unassuming throughout, Linklater\\'s incredibly involving chronicle marks an unprecedented achievement in fictional storytelling',\n",
       "   \" Boyhood fills you with openhearted happiness and awe at its scope and daring. It's a low-key masterpiece, a wistful comedy that never forgets to keep genuine emotions foremost.\",\n",
       "   \" Linklater's third masterpiece in the past decade should only affect anyone who's ever been someone else's sibling, child, parent, lover or friend.\",\n",
       "   ' Perhaps never has the long arc of the journey from childhood to college been portrayed as cohesively and convincingly as Richard Linklater has done in a film that can be plain on a moment-to-moment basis but is something quite special in its entirety.',\n",
       "   ' There\\'s a rough-edged, organic quality to \"Boyhood\" that recalls the work of those European helmers Linklater so admires: Fassbinder, Bergman, Bresson.',\n",
       "   \" The film has that deadpan Linklater tone of slacker haphazardness, but you could also say that it's almost Joycean in its appreciation of the scruffy magic of everyday life.\",\n",
       "   ' Boyhood is a narrative drama, but it unfolds like documentary truth.',\n",

       "   ' This simple yet shiver-inducing tale, the auspicious feature debut of Australian writer/director Jennifer Kent, makes for one of the better horror movies of recent times.',\n",
       "   ' It presents grief as a demon, questions reality, and creeps out the viewer by making psychopathology seem like something that could happen to anybody.',\n",
       "   ' At its heart, \"The Babadook\" is a story of mother and son, whose relationship ultimately determines whether they survive the demon - or die trying.',\n",
       "   ' In the running with Boyhood as my favorite movie of 2014 is another work that turns on the challenges of parenting. This one is a tad more insane.',\n",
