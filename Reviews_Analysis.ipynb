       "  ' Melodrama gets a bad rap sometimes.',\n",
       "  \" There's real vitality in Cooper's direction in the early passages, and, in the performances of the costars, an understanding of the ravages of romance that justifies putting ourselves through the paces of this sad story yet again. \",\n",
       "  \" I believed Bradley Cooper was a man who writes Soundgarden songs but dresses like Sturgill Simpson. I believed Lady Gaga was Joe Biden's daughter. I never wanted it to end.\",\n",
       "  \" It's the love story for our time. It's an instant cult classic. It's everything a tasteful move should not be, and yet it's an undeniable success.\",\n",
       "  ' The high-voltage ghost of Judy Garland haunts every frame and illuminates every shadow in the film, and Lady Gaga seems to know it.',\n",
       "  \" If 2011's The Artist was an homage, this is more of a burlesque, a hot mess of a movie that takes its dramatic cues from the camp excesses of the drag queens among whom our hammered hero finds the lucky Lady.\",\n",
       "  ' \"A Star is Born\" isn\\'t perfect, but what Cooper and Gaga are able to do with the tale make it a delicate love story and triumphant tribute to the artistic spirit.',\n",
       "  \" Cooper has managed to do the impossible. He's put together an instant movie classic that will have audiences falling in love with his brand new creation.\",\n",
       "  \" It's Cooper's first time as director and Gaga's first major movie role, but you'd never guess it from the skill and passion they bring to the project.\",\n",
       "  \" In A Star Is Born, love hurts. But it's labor that breaks your heart. \",\n",
       "  \" When you go into seeing A Star Is Born, one thing is always clear: You're in for great music and a broken heart.\",\n",
       "  \" For Cooper, it's a polished directorial debut. For Gaga, it's as comfortable a bridge from pop stardom into the movie world as one could imagine. As duets go, that's the sort of combined star power that's difficult to beat.\",\n",
       "  ' The duo share an excellent, realistic dynamic. Neither delivers actorish moments angling for awards and prestige.',\n",
       "  \" The role of Ally is so meta as to cast doubt on whether Lady Gaga can play other kinds of parts; the performance is so galvanizing that you don't remotely care.\",\n",
       "  ' It feels somehow compact despite its sprawling two-hour-and-15-minute size, with nary a scene or frame wasted as it builds to its inexorable yet heart-shattering finale.',\n",
       "  \" Like its finest antecedents, it wrings tears from its romance and thrills from a steadfast belief in old-fashioned, big-feeling cinema. That it's also a perverse fantasy about men, women, love and sacrifice makes it all the better.\",\n",
       "  ' This is the best Star Is Born yet, and one of the best movies of the year.',\n",
       "  ' A Star Is Born, is simply terrific -- a big-scale cinematic delight that will have the masses singing, swooning and sobbing along with it.',\n",
       "  ' First-time director Cooper and co-star Gaga make beautiful music together in this glossy update of a Hollywood classic.',\n",
       "  ' Even the most hard-hearted and cynical viewer is likely to have an emotional reaction, and this is as much a testimony to the way Cooper tells the tale as to the story itself.',\n",
       "  ' A blockbuster romance that looks and feels like an indie film, all in service of an expression of pure love.',\n",
       "  ' Somehow, Cooper has made a Hollywood fairy tale seem utterly believable and magical at the same time.',\n",
       "  ' Cooper, in his directing debut, puts us inside the music and the drama and lets it swirl around us.',\n",
       "  ' Passionate, emotional and fearless, the gangbusters \"A Star Is Born\" is poised to become the movie of the moment - the one everyone has to see right now.',\n",
       "  \" By dumping the usual Hollywood bull for something that feels raw, scrappy and lived in, Cooper and Gaga knock it out of the park. Their movie, one of the year's very best, is a modern musical classic. The Oscar race is officially on.\",\n",
       "  ' The film feels fresh from thunderous start to exquisite finish.',\n",
       "  ' Lady Gaga has traveled by egg, donned skirt steak and taken part in a TV blood orgy. But her biggest transformation occurs in the new film \"A Star Is Born.\" In it, she becomes an Oscar-worthy actress.',\n",

       "  ' With their phenomenal \"A Star Is Born,\" Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper upend expectations and spectacularly freshen up a stock Hollywood story.',\n",
       "  ' The result is pure Saturday-night moviegoing: it gives you one hell of a wallop, then you wake up on Sunday morning without a scratch.',\n",
       "  ' \"A Star is Born\" offers a suitably jaundiced glimpse of starmaking machinery at its most cynical, but also its most thrilling and gratifying.',\n",
       "  \" Gaga keeps the film's heart pumping. She's down-to-Earth and radiant-in other words, every bit as good as everyone has been saying.\",\n",
       "  ' Lady Gaga triumphs as a young woman averse to artifice and fame-hounding. The movie is a hell of a magic act.',\n",
       "  ' Their chemistry is undeniable, their duets infectious and moving the action into the contemporary music scene, where Ally is rapidly reconfigured as a sequin-studded red head flanked by unnecessary dancers, strikes a long line of emotional notes.',\n",
       "  ' An invigorating paean to the joys of making art, the momentum that comes with sudden inspiration, and how swooningly romantic it can all feel.',\n",
       "  \" It's remarkable... just how many fresh reserves of emotion Cooper teases out of a well-worn formula.\",\n",
       "  ' This story has been told several times before-and influenced other similar romances-but Cooper and Gaga find a way to make this feel fresh and new.',\n",
       "  \" Gaga's easy, offhanded command of the screen matches up well with Cooper's sincere, straight-ahead portrayal of a good man undermining his own talent. \",\n",
       "  ' What keeps the film from feeling like a mere rehash is the gut-level romanticism of it all.',\n",
       "  ' Calling the new A Star Is Born a \"valentine\" from its star, Lady Gaga, to her fans sounds a bit coy and delicate, so let\\'s call it what it really is: a hot French kiss (with full-on tongue), filled with passion, tears and a staggering amount of chutzpah.',\n",
       "  \" Credit to Cooper for delivering his best, most soulful performance while pulling double duty behind the camera, but it's his co-star whose magnetism most draws you into their world - and keeps you there even when the film hits the occasional wrong note.\",\n",
       "  \" A Star Is Born tries very, very hard to be the most emotional movie of 2018. I'm not convinced it wins on that front, but I can say it gets the prize for most hysterical melodrama. Take it as a compliment.\",\n",
       "  ' Star is less a story now than a myth - not so much reborn as recast, and passed on to the care of the next generation.',\n",
       "  ' Cooper and Lady Gaga are dynamite together; this is a story that lives and dies by the central relationship and the instant chemistry that must blossom between them, and these two have it in spades.',\n",
       "  ' You come away feeling something for these people, flawed individuals who are trying to hold their cracked pieces of self together-or to mend the cracks of those they love.',\n",
       "  ' This is a durable tale of romance, heady fame and crushing tragedy, retold for a new generation with heart and grit.',\n",
       "  ' \"A Star Is Born\" is that thing we always yearn for but so rarely get to see: a transcendent Hollywood movie.',\n",
       "  \" An example of Big Movie Studio Craft at its most well-thought out; among the many contingents of moviegoers it will please will be the 'they don't make 'em like that anymore' crowd.\"]]"

       "   \" The identity politics provide a fresh spin to the genre's increasingly tedious narrative formula.\",\n",
       "   \" Jordan has swagger to spare, with those rolling shoulders, but there's a breath of charm, too, all the more seductive in the overblown atmosphere of Marvel. He's twice as pantherish as the Panther.\",\n",
       "   ' Coogler is trying for a lot of things in Black Panther, probably too many, but there is also a winning modesty to his ambition.',\n",
       "   \" Ultimately, it's more interesting to think about than it is to watch.\",\n",
